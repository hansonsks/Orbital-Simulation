# Orbital Motion - A very basic simulation of sending a satellite to Mars using the Hohmann Transfer Orbit
RunSolar displays the animation of the five innermost planets in the solar system

RunExperiments runs each of the experiments based on the number you put in

Note that Experiments 3 (DoomsdayPlanetaryAlignment) and 5 (Hohmann) take hours to compute

Experiment 6 is RunSolar, but allows you to choose whether you want to see Jupiter

The rest should take no longer than 10 seconds to finish
